# DB-Legends-Sound-Extraction-Tool
Tool to sort & extract sound files from Dragon Ball Legends (mobile game).

To use the Python version of this tool, execute the following in a terminal (should work on Windows, macOS, or Linux)

```bash
python main.py # for all clips
python main.py CHARACTER LANGUAGE # for one character. CHARACTER is name of character like shallot and LANGUAGE can either be eng or jpn
```

All that is required is Python installed. Also there is a zip file generated at the end named wavs.zip.
